	#
	# Important Notice: You must make declare global variables f and f_param on every processor. You
	# can do this in your main function by typing (for example): 
	# @everywhere global f_param = ["style"=>"mxmyhxhy","Niter"=> 100,"alpha"=>1,"fmax"=>80]

	# f is an array of functions that have the following syntax: d2,h2 = f(d1,h1,f_param), where 
	# param is a dictionary (Dict) of parameters for the function.
	#
	# note that param should contain parameters for the patching and 
	# unpatching operations.
	#
	# to execute the code type:  julia -p 4 my_code.jl where 4 can be replaced with the number of 
	# processors you wish to use.
